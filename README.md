# CurrencyConverter
Converts value from one currency to another using currencylayer.com


How to run this project?
- Download source code from main branch.
- Go to source code directory and run `pod install` from Terminal.
- Open `CurrencyConverter.xcworkspace` in XCode and hit the Run button.


Note: I have added some basic XCTestCases which does general checks for the source code. I am looking further to integrate `Nimble + Snapshot` following this guide: https://medium.com/cocoaacademymag/what-ive-learned-in-a-month-of-tdd-2fdcb302c901.
